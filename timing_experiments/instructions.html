      <h2>Instructions (Please Read Carefully)</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the timing experiments interface!</p>
      <p>In the following experiment, you will be presented with a passage and asked a series of questions on the coreferences within that passage.</p>
      <p>You will be timed on how long you take to answer each question, and this timing data will be essential in calibrating our results.
        <b>Therefore, you should try to answer each question as fast as possible, without sacrificing accuracy.</b>
        There is no pause button. Thus, please ensure you have a continuous 30 minute block of time without interruptions.
        <b>Please do not close the window or pause the experiment at any time before your time is up.</b>
        There is also no undo button. If you make a mistake, disregard it and proceed onto the next question as normal.
        The important part is not to let anything affect your pace--the timing data is crucial.</p>
        <!--Remember, the timing data is crucial.-->

      <h3>What is coreference?</h3>
      <p>Coreference refers to two or more sequences of words with a passage that refer to the same person, thing, event, etc. For example:</p>
